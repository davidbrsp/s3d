This is the companion software package of the book
"Design and Implementation of 3D Graphics Systems" 
by Jonas Gomes, Luiz Velho, Mario Costa Sousa.

The software contains an implementation of all the
algorithms described in the book.


CONTENTS
--------

The directory hierarchy structure is as follows:

./s3d
     /base    - Source of the Base library
     /proj    - Source of the Applications
     /model   - Geometric Model
     /scn     - 3D Scene Files
     /pic     - Images
     /demo    - Scripts to Run the demos
     /build         - CMAKE build dir
     /build/bin     - Executables
     /build/lib     - Libraries
     /build/include - Header files


INSTALLATION
------------

To install the software run these commands in the "build" directory
    cmake ..
    make
    make install

This should generate, compile and install the libraries and applications.


TESTING
-------

To play the demos, run the main shell in the demo directory
  cd demo
  sh run-all

This will execute all applications with test data.


COMPATIBILITY

This software was developed using GNU tools under the
Linux operating system. It has also been ported to
MacOS X and the Windows environment using MinGW.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

The software needs the following development tools
 cmake, sh, make, gcc, bison, flex.
Also the graphics output needs the SDL library.


NOTES on MinGW INSTALLATION

1. Install MinGW
2. Install MSYS
3. Get and Unzip langtools.zip on MinGW root
4. Untar s3d.tar.gz (do not use winzip!)
